This is the source code that runs Flickr Chatterbox (chatterbox). chatterbox is
a Flickr API (web) application that runs on the Google AppEngine (GAE) platform:

http://flickr-chatterbox.appspot.com

It asks the Flickr API for photos belonging to your contacts that have been
commented on in the the last 30 minutes.

I find it useful for discovering photos from my contacts that have otherwise
fallen through the cracks. Your mileage may vary.

REQUIREMENTS

If you want to run your own version of chatterbox, you will need:

* A valid Flickr API key, registered as a web application. Both the API key and
  the application secret will need to be added to the config.py file.

  If you don't have a Flickr API key, you can get one here:

  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/

* A valid GAE account and a recent version of the GAE SDK for Python (>= 1.2.3)
  which can be downloaded from:

  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

* gae-FlickrApp

  http://github.com/straup/gae-flickrapp/tree/master

* gae-APIApp

  http://github.com/straup/gae-APIApp/tree/master

They will need to be installed as follows:

NOTES

The CSS is still a mess and contains all kinds of inline definitions and
classes/IDs that aren't actually used anywhere.
